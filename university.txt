 university (from Latin universitas 'a whole') is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which awards academic degrees in several academic disciplines. Universities typically offer both undergraduate and postgraduate programs in different schools or faculties of learning.

The word university is derived from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium, which roughly means "community of teachers and scholars".[1]

The first universities were created in Europe by Catholic Church monks.[2][3][4][5][6] The University of Bologna (Universit√† di Bologna), founded in 1088, is the first university in the sense of:

5independence from the ecclesiastic schools, although conducted by both clergy and non-clergy.
Using the word universitas (which was coined at its foundation).
Issuing secular and non-secular degrees: grammar, rhetoric, logic, theology, canon law
